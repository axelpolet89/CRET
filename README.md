# css-suite

Suite that should be able to automatically re-engineer CSS code in order to make it less error prone and more maintainable.
Output will be code in the SCSS (SASS) preprocessor language.

This tool will use the CILLA plug-in for Crawljax, because it allows crawling DOM using CSS selectors. See https://github.com/saltlab/cilla
